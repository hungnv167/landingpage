                                Motorcycles are the most popular form of transport in Vientiane. Many motorists are
                                underaged or
                                do not have a proper driving licence. They also tend to drive under the influence of
                                alcohol,
                                hence drunk driving is the leading cause of road fatalities in Laos.

                                out of busy traffic to get to a crash site within three to seven minutes. On a busy

                                respond to an average of 20 calls.

                                Accidents usually involve motorcyclists, and since helmets are seldom worn, the risk of
                                getting seriously hurt is greater. Volunteers attend to varying severities of injuries;
                                from minor cuts and scrapes to broken limbs and horrific accidents that end in death -
                                as many as 50 a month. ​To date, Vientiane Rescue has saved more than 60,000 people -
                                from just 300 in 2010 to over 15,000 in 2019.

                                service is often the first and only place people turn to in an emergency. Besides road
                                accidents, Vientiane Rescue’s teams also fight fires and deliver babies. This evening,
                                volunteers respond to a domestic violence case, which would also involve local police.

                                Even though road accidents are common in Vientiane, crash scenes still attract the
                                morbid curiosity of bystanders. But for some who have witnessed one too many tragedies,
                                it was no longer enough to stand by and do nothing. Instead, they were moved to make a
                                difference, signing up as volunteers with Vientiane Rescue.

                                A desire to “help others”, “save lives”, “make their city a safer place” and “to become
                                better humans”. These are the most common reasons volunteers give to explain why they
                                dedicate their free time to Vientiane Rescue. While there is a core team of about 60
                                full-timers, many of the over 500 unpaid volunteers are students or juggle day jobs. One
                                of them is Kik, 24, who is a cashier at a local bank during the day. Sébastien says
                                dedicated volunteers like Kik, who display leadership skills, are what make Vientiane
                                Rescue so special. He says they also look for qualities, such as professionalism,
                                courage, solidarity, compassion, altruism, commitment and sacrifice. Uniforms are only
                                given out to trainees who show up regularly for at least three months.

                                ​Sébastien also relies on the original group of founding members, who were teenagers
                                when they started up Vientiane Rescue. Now in their early-to-mid-20s they have taken on
                                more administrative roles, such as station deputy chief. Despite running the day-to-day
                                operations at the stations, they continue to head out on emergency interventions with
                                volunteers. Says Sébastien, “Being a good manager is not sitting behind a desk, it's
                                being with the team inside the ambulances. So each of us continues to work on the roads,
                                less often, but still.” Their loyalty to Vientiane Rescue all these years is due to
                                their steadfast belief in the importance of the service they provide. Plus, “they also
                                like it,” says Sébastien. “And you can’t get respect if you don't show your commitment.”

                                Johnson is no stranger to high-stress situations. The 25-year-old volunteer is a
                                commercial pilot with Lao Skyway. He signed up to volunteer with Vientiane Rescue after
                                witnessing one too many accidents. He says that the law prevents people without the
                                necessary qualifications to assist accident victims. This motivated him to get proper
                                training. He is a qualified emergency medical technician (EMT) and is also a diving
                                instructor. Fearing for his safety, his parents were initially against him volunteering.
                                But after hearing his stories of rescue and bravado, are ardent supporters now. The
                                greatest reward from saving lives is when victims recover and return to say, ‘Thank
                                You.’ Johnson says the feeling is comparable to landing a plane flawlessly.

                                A father-of-three, Ai has volunteered with Vientiane Rescue for two-and-a-half years.
                                The decision to join the team was precipitated by a loss in the family. His
                                sister-in-law died in an accident six years ago, because no one rescued her in time. The
                                engineer works at an international hotel chain managing its fire safety and gas system.
                                Ai has become an indispensable addition to the team. He also represents Vientiane Rescue
                                to train local firefighters. Here he prepares a training presentation, with the help of
                                his son, Ton.

                                He is now in charge of the diving, fire and rope rescue teams. His interest in first aid
                                and rescue was nurtured since young. And he continues to develop his skills by
                                continually training.

                                juggle school work and volunteering. His commitment is clear, becoming one of the
                                youngest volunteers to complete EMT training. Ai says he is proud to see his son mature
                                over the years, and believes that first aid rescue has taught him the importance of
                                responsible driving.

                                ​All's quiet for now at Dong Dok station, where Kik, Johnson, Ai and Ton volunteer. Dong
                                Dok is the largest of four stations run by Vientiane Rescue in the capital. They also
                                have one station in the southern city of Pakse, and two in the northern part of the
                                country in Vang Vieng and Xieng Khouang. Across all seven stations, it has 20 ambulances
                                and two fire trucks.

                                ​Ai and Ton check the pressure of the station's supply of oxygen tanks to make sure they
                                function properly. When the dam collapsed in southeast Laos in 2018, Ai took leave from
                                his job to represent Vientiane Rescue during the search and rescue operation. He says
                                there were moments he feared for the lives of his team of volunteers, as they had to
                                search for survivors in the river at near zero visibility. There was also the lurking
                                threat of unexploded ordnance (UXO) spread across the area by the floods. But Ai
                                understood that risking their lives was integral to what they signed up for as first
                                responders.

                                note. He surprises call centre manager Mimi with a birthday cake. The fun ends abruptly
                                when the phones start ringing. Before she could cut her cake, Mimi dashes back to the
                                room to handle the calls.

                                ​Mimi, 25, is in her element as she straddles the emergency calls and dispatches the
                                ambulances from the station nearest the accident site. The call centre receives some 500
                                calls a month. Even as a paid full-timer, Mimi continues to volunteer her spare hours to
                                respond to accidents. One of the things she enjoys most is to deliver babies. Mimi has
                                dedicated the past five years of her life to Vientiane Rescue and acts as a big sister
                                to other volunteers. She says before Vientiane Rescue, she used to stay out late and
                                party a lot. Since then, she has become more serious and likes herself better. Although
                                she lives at Dong Dok permanently, she returns to her family home regularly. Her dream
                                is to work at Vientiane Rescue indefinitely. The best part of her job? Interacting with
                                people from different backgrounds.

                                Dok station, as the team heads out on their rescue mission.

                                At the wheel next to Johnson, Ai skillfully manoeuvres confidently through rush-hour
                                traffic as fast as he can. It can be risky and harrowing when other drivers on the road
                                break the law, for example, by speeding or skipping red lights.

                                victim, a motorcyclist, onto the stretcher. Back in the ambulance, it is a family affair
                                with Ai driving the team to the nearest hospital and Ton in the back chatting and
                                watching over the patient.

                                ​Back at Dong Dok station, Kik has just arrived for her shift. Trained as an EMT, she is
                                in charge of advising and briefing newcomers and teaching them first aid. The most
                                regular advice she gives her volunteers is “to put their heart” in to what they are
                                doing. And reminds them that it is “not a game”, because they have people’s lives in
                                their hands. Since joining the Vientiane Rescue team, Kik says she has matured in her
                                thinking and behaviour and is better able to adapt to strangers.

                                ​But Kik’s quiet night ends soon enough when an emergency call comes in. She hops into
                                the ambulance with her team and preps them from the front seat.

                                ​A self-confessed risk-taker, Kik is in her element in the thick of the action. Her
                                steely concentration is nothing less than admirable. She directs her team of volunteers
                                to move the victim onto a stretcher after wrapping a brace around his neck. The young
                                driver is semi-conscious and visibly drunk after crashing his motorbike into the side of
                                the road.

                                ​Following administrative processes to the letter is key to ensuring all accident
                                victims Vientiane Rescue delivers to the hospital are given the best chances of
                                surviving their injuries. For this volunteer, it means referring to the scribbled notes
                                on her hand when filling in a detailed report about the accident.

                                ​At the hospital, Sébastien chats with volunteers after dropping off an accident
                                survivor at A&E. Having lived in the country for nearly a decade, his command of Lao is
                                fairly strong and has developed a relaxed and jovial relationship with the volunteers.
                                Their camaraderie is evident. Over the years, Sébastien and his teams have also built a
                                respectful relationship with staff at the local hospitals, like Friendship Hospital.
                                This has helped to improve the survival rate of accident victims, which has improved
                                morale among volunteers.

                                After another hectic night, it's time to fill up on piping hot bowls of noodle soup.
                                Sébastien takes his volunteers out for supper at a popular street side stall. He cares
                                deeply for his volunteers and worries about their future, particularly for those who
                                volunteer full-time with Vientiane Rescue. He wants an equitable life for them. This
                                means finding more avenues of funding so he can pay full-timers a living wage. So far,
                                the service has been supported by private donations​, and operates on a tight budget of
                                US$5,000 a month.

                                ​Back at the station, the rest of the volunteers return from their rescue missions, and
                                catch up over a home-cooked dinner. The atmosphere is light and filled with laughter,
                                showing a deep bond between them strengthened by the sheer amount of time they spend
                                together. Their friendships help to soften the often bloody scenes they see every day.
                                Sébastien says that when the people they save and their families donate items to the
                                stations to show their gratitude, the thoughtfulness raises the spirits of volunteers
                                and gives them the impetus to continue to save lives. In fact, many volunteers say they
                                cannot imagine ever leaving Vientiane Rescue, their second family.

                                ​Some of these friendships have blossomed into romances. Exhausted from a long day at
                                the office, Kik decides to have an early night. Before heading to bed, she video calls
                                her fiance, who is also a volunteer with Vientiane Rescue. He was part of the 2018 cave
                                rescue team in Chiang Rai, Thailand. Kik says he was coaching and advising her when she
                                first joined. Their shared experiences and interest in helping people has brought them
                                closer and made it easier for their relationship to succeed.

                                station. But those still on shift find any chance they can get to take a quick nap
                                during lull periods. This helps them stay alert after a long day when an emergency comes
                                in the dead of the night.

                                darkened room. Within the huddle of this touching moment, the future of the Vientiane
                                Rescue family looks bright. Sébastien believes that the service will live on as long as
                                volunteers continue to take pride in and ownership of Vientiane Rescue.

                        <h4>About Vientiane Rescue</h4>
                        <p>Vientiane Rescue is a volunteer-run rescue service in Vientiane, Laos. They are the largest
                            such service in the country, responding to over 5,760 road accidents annually (2015
                            figures). Made up of over 200 volunteers, 8 ambulances, a fire-fighting unit, a scuba rescue
                            team as well as hydraulic rescue and excavation teams, Vientiane Rescue has grown to over
                            200 volunteers working from 4 different locations in Vientiane.

                            Vientiane Rescue was among the 6 recipients of the 2016 Ramon Magsaysay Award, commonly
                            regarded as Asia's equivalent of the Nobel Prize. According to the jury, the award
                            “recognizes its heroic work in saving Laotian lives in a time and place of great need, under
                            the most deprived of circumstances, inspiring by their passionate humanitarianism a similar
                            generosity of spirit in many others.” The jury further commented that in responding to
                            between 15 - 30 accidents a day, Vientiane Rescue helped save an estimated 10,000 lives
                            between 2011 and 2015.
